<h2> Purpose: </h2>

 - Repeat Step 1 for 100 days consecutively (you can take a day break but not two break in a row)
 
 <br>
 <h2> About: </h2>
 
 - Came across a post on Twitter, with a hashtag #freecodecamp #100DaysOfCode when i got into deep, realized there was much more bigger going on somewhere. (Just felt Awsome to know these upskilling and confident which are build by the devs)
 - Sitting on weekend it stuck into my mind that why not me.
 - Already working with Java, Spring and other Middle layer technlogies i was asked about Angular, other UI freamworks growing during company projects.
 - Thought of taking this challenge and learning something new, something different with confidecen and comfort.
 - Created a new github personal profile, new freecodecamp account on 15th September 2018
 - Just remember, "Every day" 1 hour of code for "100" days.
 
<br>

<h2> Specification: </h2>

 - Completing all the course, projects and learning Angular, JS, HTML, CSS.
 - Everyday i will code i will write a post here as well as share it on Twitter.
