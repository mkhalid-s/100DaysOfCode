# 100DaysOfCode

### Repo for all Actions, Project and activity of freeCodeCamp/ 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Purpose:

 - Code for an hour every day (making a habit of learning and coding independently, not just CTRL C+ CTRL+V)
 - Repeat Step 1 for 100 days consecutively (you can take a day break but not two break in a row)
 

 ## About:
 
 - Came across a post on Twitter, with a hashtag #freecodecamp #100DaysOfCode when i got into deep, realized there was much more bigger going on somewhere. (Just felt Awsome to know these upskilling and confident which are build by the devs)
 - Sitting on weekend it stuck into my mind that why not me.
 - Already working with Java, Spring and other Middle layer technlogies i was asked about Angular, other UI freamworks growing during company projects.
 - Thought of taking this challenge and learning something new, something different with confidecen and comfort.
 - Created a new github personal profile, new freecodecamp account on 15th September 2018
 - Just remember, "Every day" 1 hour of code for "100" days.
